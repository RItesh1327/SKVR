# SKVR

This VR project, developed using Unity for the Oculus platform, offers an immersive simulation of a kitchen environment. The game is designed to educate users about the various tasks and 
            challenges associated with working in a professional kitchen. To enhance the learning experience, I integrated a custom chatbot powered by ChatGPT, featuring both voice and text-based interactions. 
            This chatbot provides real-time information on kitchen standards, ensuring users gain a comprehensive understanding of best practices in a kitchen setting.
